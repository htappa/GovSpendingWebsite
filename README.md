# GovSpendingWebsite
This website visualizes government expenditure in the sectors of Military, Healthcare, and Education for eleven different countries. The selected countries include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. These countries are all members of the G20, considered economic world leaders, and were selected due to their influence on the global economy and the availability of publicly available data on government spending.  

Data on military expenditure, population, and GDP was retrieved from the World Bank Open Data database. Data on healthcare expenditure was retrieved from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) iLibrary, using "Health Spending" as an indicator. Data on education expenditure was retrieved from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics database, using "Government Expenditure on Education US$ (millions)" as an indicator.  

The analysis is divided into four categories:

- Military expenditure compared to healthcare and education expenditure
- Expenditure as a percentage of GDP
- Expenditure per capita
- Fastest growing countries in terms of healthcare and education expenditure
